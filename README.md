#  Lemon Squeezer App (Learning Project)

A simple and fun app built as part of my learning journey with **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**.  
This app simulates squeezing a lemon to make lemonade — it's small, but it helped me understand modern UI development in the Jetpack ecosystem.

---

## Purpose

This app was built to:

- Practice building UIs using **Jetpack Compose**
- Understand **state management** with `remember` and `mutableStateOf`
- Learn how to structure **Composable functions**
- Build confidence in Kotlin-based Android development

---

## What It Does

- Shows a lemon tree → tap to pick a lemon  
- Squeeze the lemon by tapping multiple times  
- Drink the lemonade  
- Restart the process
